Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Terrorism Dataset.



The objective of this project is to perform an 'EDA' on the dataset 'Global Terrorism'.
  ● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.
  ● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?
  
  
Steps Involved in this EDA
  1)IMPORTING THE REQUIRED LIBRARIES
  2)LOADING AND READING THE DATASET
  3)FEATURE EXPLORATION
  4)PLOTTING A HEATMAP
  5)DATA VISUALIZATION
  6)CONCLUSION
  
What all conclusions can be drawn : 
  
  **HOT ZONES**

 1.In Country wise terrorist attack :-
    a)Iraq : high rate
    b)Spain : low rate

 2.In State wise terrorist attack :- 
    a)Baghdad had the highest rate whereas,
    b)Antioquia had the least

 3.For Region wise terrorist attack :-
    a)Middle East and North Africa was at the first position.
    b)Australiasia and Oceania was at the last position.

 4.Among the most frequently attacked cities :-
    a)Baghdad was highly affected since the first one is unknown.

 5.For year wise terrorist attack
    a)2014 was the year most frequent terrorist attack in the past and,
    b)1988 was the year with least attacks.
    
**INSIGHTS DRAWN**

 1)The most frequent attack type was Bombing/Explosion. 
 2)The groups involved in terrorist activity were Talibans since the fist type of groups were unknown to people.
 3)The most commonly used weapon for terrorist activity were Explosives.
So from these above statement we can conclude that,it was wise for the people to stay at homes and avoid gatherings at crowded places or areas.

**FOR KILLED Vs WOUNDED VISUALIZATION PLOT,**

 1)The census shows that most of the people who were killed and wounded lies under the range (300,1000).
 2)The highest number of people killed and wounded due to the terrorist activity was 1400 and 8000 respectively.
 
 
**FROM THIS PROJECT BASED ON THE OBSERVATIONS I CAN FINALLY CONCLUDE THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A PERCEPTION THAT MUSLIMS ARE THE SUPPORTERS OF TERRORISM,WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT MUSLIMS WERE THE ONES WHO WERE HIGHLY DAMAGED WITH INJURIES AND DEATH RATES BY THE IMPACT OF TERRORIST ATTACK.**

**ON HAVING A KEEN OBSERVATION FOR THE COUNTRY WISE TERRORIST ATTACK GRAPHICS,IT APPEARS TO BE STATED THAT *IRAQ,AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN* WERE THE MOST DAMAGED COUNTRIES.ALL THESE COUNTRIES WERE MUSLIM COUNTRIES AND THEY WERE THE ONES WHO WERE BADLY AFFECTED ON HAVING A COMPARISON WITH REST COUNTRIES.**
